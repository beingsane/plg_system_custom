Custom Plugin
=============

This Joomla plugin gives examples of how to use traits and a parent
class, to easily create a custom plugin per project.

This example shows the following:
- Simple plugin entry because of mixin methods
- Mixin classes added through a protected variable `$mixins`
- Runtime calling of the right mixin methods
- Mixins grouped in subfolders with namespaces
- Some Reflection fun
